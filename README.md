# 20 JavaScript Web Projects by *[Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/)*

The course includes a wide variety of JS apps like: 
* An exchange rate calculator
* A form validation logic 
* A breakout game 

It's a great experience to learn how to interact with the DOM as well as how to fetch APIs and populate the UI with responses. 

## How to run each project 

We're using the Visual Code extension *[Live Server](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/)* to easily host the projects locally.

Download it and follow the instructions to launch a server on the **index.html** page of each project.
